I find it rather crazy that our&nbsp;identities&nbsp;are so&nbsp;dependant on what other people do or are. Some examples (none of which I agree&nbsp;with/ am happy with):<div><ul><li>I can't be seen to be embarrassed or upset, that will ruin my reputation and therefore my self-esteem will go down.</li><li><br></li><li>We can't allow gay marriage, that will ruin marriage for everyone.<br></li></ul></div>
