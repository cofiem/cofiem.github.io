"I have approximate answers and possible beliefs in different degrees of certainty about different things, but I'm not absolutely sure of anything."
Prove: from Latin probare ‘test, approve, demonstrate’ - it is not about being certain.

I'm not sure I understand your point. Anyway, I'm commenting more on the general media saying things like 'science proves X', when really most results only give a slightly improved likelihood of representing reality.
