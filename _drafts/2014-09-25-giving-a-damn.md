Have I mentioned recently that I loathe some of our elected representatives? Family First Senator Bob Day and Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi (who else) back to wanting to change racial discrimination laws. Temporary protection visas back thanks to Palmer and mates.
Com'on, are we really this useless at figuring out real solutions and actually giving a damn about people?
