I cried through this... So true for me, as well. I may not perform, but I do like singing in my own out-of-tune way. I don't stutter then. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MegHiL93B0&list

When I'm grown - I won't have a stutter
can talk about it now, because I've reached this point where I'm pretty sure that I'm grown now.
Interesting angles
 - meeting another stutterer - think you're making fun of each other
 - think you're drunk, nervous, afraid. You're not, but that's what many people associate with stuttering.
 - forgotten name
 - proper nouns are the worst - coming to word, know that you'll stutter, can change the word
 - loophole method of using speech - change it, trick brain
 - can't change people's names - so don't tend to pay attention
 
S's and t's kryptonite - stuck on the s. t.

Alot of therapy - smooth speech - almost sing - not actually me.
economy of (air)time is paramount

Singing
 - more than making nice souds, nice songs
 - more than feeling understood, feeling good
 - not mythology
 - impossible to stutter when you sing - sweet relief, only time when I feel fluent
 - when what comes out is exactly what was intended
