<P>Well, I found this bike on the way back from a Christmas party. It looked quite cool covered in snow, so I thought a picture was in order. Dunno how anyone could ride on it - Would take ages to get the snow off, and then it'd be soaked. Well, they'd probably just pick it up and take the train, like me...</p>
