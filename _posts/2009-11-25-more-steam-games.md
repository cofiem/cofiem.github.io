<p>I've been enjoying some Steam Demos recently, including Plants vs Zombies and <a href="http://www.ratloop.com/?games/mightier">Mightier</a>, which is freely available on the creator's website. Today, and the next few days, there's a sale on some Steam games - I've just picked up <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/3590/">Plants vs Zombies</a> for half price ($5USD), and <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/29180/">Osmos</a> for ($2USD). There are a bunch of other <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/early-holiday">games on sale</a> too. There will apparently be different sales over five days.</p>

<p>For some reason I'm coming to really like the indie games and casual games more and more. I used to think casual games were flash games, but they can also be desktop, and they can certainly be great fun! I especially like the Steam Achievements - things to work towards. </p>

<p>It would be nice to see some more emphasis on independent games on Steam and other services. Right now as far as I can see, most or all of the advertisements are for the more expensive or more hardcore games. Other stores such as <a href="http://www.impulsedriven.com/explore/software">Impulse</a> also include other software, like design apps. Right now they're mostly all from Stardock Design and Corel, so there's not much that's interesting.</p>

<p>Hmm.. so, with all these neat ways of getting software online (including the mother of them all, the <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2009/08/ubuntu-appcentre.html">Debian Application Tools</a>), there's no reason anymore for boxed software.</p>
