<p>I learnt quite a lot from this article on <a href="http://vadamagazine.com/30/05/2013/opinions/surf-terfs-on-trans-exclusionary-radical-feminists">Trans*-Exclusionary Radical Feminists</a>. There's also quite a lot in it that is sad and disgusting.</p>
<p>The last paragraph was a good, brief summary of how I see Feminism.</p>
<blockquote>
... feminists who echo Flavia Dzodan’s battle cry "My feminism will be intersectional, or it will be bullshit." Feminism is not just built to cater for rich, white, cis women any more - it’s there for everyone. It’s there to ensure that everybody gets the same opportunities in society, and to do that it has to fight for everybody - <a href="http://jezebel.com/5992479/if-i-admit-that-hating-men-is-a-thing-will-you-stop-turning-it-into-a-self+fulfilling-prophecy">even you, Men’s Rights Activists</a>. Feminists hate the patriarchy, not other people.
