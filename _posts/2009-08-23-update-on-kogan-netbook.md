<p>A quick note about updating linux (in my case Ubuntu Netbok Remix) on a Kogan Netbook.As I mentioned in a <a href="http://anotherbyte.net/blog/kogan-agora-pronetbook-hands-on-review">previous post</a>, you might be required to <a href="http://agoranetbook.kayno.net/2009/04/25/oh-my-touchpad-doesnt-work/ ">add &#39;i8042.nomux&#39;</a> to the kernel boot options to get the touchpad working.</p><p>Don&#39;t forget to add this back into the boot options when it gets updated! Some updates include a new kernel image, and this also automatically updates the menu.lst, removing the change. It&#39;s annoying, but easy to fix if as long as you remember! </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
