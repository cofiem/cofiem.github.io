<p>Over the next couple of weeks, I'm going to look into experimenting with some open source libraries. Coz it's fun. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/aforge/">Aforge.Net</a> is a "Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence" C# library. Comes with a range of algorithms, including some very neat ones for image processing. There are two things I want to try with this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some face detection (and maybe even recognition!) in my photos. it would be great to have a desktop version of <a href="http://picasa.google.com/intl/en_us/features-nametags.html">Google web albums name tags</a>. Search by Person's name! Not sure I'll be able to get fa r, but there's a lot of info out there.</li>
<li>Search using a photo. Or a colour. That would be really useful. Again, quite difficult, but there's plenty of info out there, as well as algorithms for comparing images.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the spirit of images, I'm also hoping to get more active with Flickr. I'd like to start sharing more photos of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kramrecords/">landscapes and other things</a>.</p>
