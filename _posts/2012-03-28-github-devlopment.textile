<p>I recently read this article about <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/github/all/1">Lord of the Files: How GitHub Tamed Free Software (And More)</a>. There's some interesting trivia about how GitHub was formed and has developed, particularly regarding the use of socialising and social coding to differentiate it from existing repositories like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a>. I particularly liked this comment about the possible wider and future impacts of GitHub:
</p>

<blockquote>
A tool like GitHub could also make it easier for constituents to track and even voice their opinions on changes to complex legal code. "When you really think about it, a bill is a branch of the law," [Ryan Blair] says. "Iâ€™m just in love with the idea of a constituent being able to send their state senator a pull request."
</blockquote>

<p>It's interesting that GitHub is moving closer to crowd sourcing - where volunteers fix other users' code, just because they can. It may or may not benefit the volunteer personally, but the collective improvement of easily-accessible code should improve things for everyone.</p>
