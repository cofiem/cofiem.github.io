<p>Despite HTML5 apparently <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/blog/HTML_5_Won_t_Be_Ready_Until_2022DOT_Yes__2022DOT">not being completely ready until 2022</a> (yes, 2022. Will people on Mars care about the Internet?), it might be worth <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/04/designing-a-html-5-layout-from-scratch/">exploring HTML5</a> for a refresh for this site. I'd like to learn more about HTML5, so redoing this site would be good practise as well as updating it and changing the look.</p>
