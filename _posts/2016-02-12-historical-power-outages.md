I was interested in past electricity outages in Brisbane. As far as I know, there isn't a dataset for this. So I thought I'd create one.

I made an [open source](https://github.com/cofiem/power-outages) [website](http://power-outages.from.anotherbyte.net/) to capture and display outages per region and suburb. It also includes the electricity demand.

If there's anything else you think could be done with this data, please [let me know](https://twitter.com/cofiem)!
