As part of my phd I created two exploratory prototype websites. I recruited people to evaluate them and collected the data. The websites were then removed and not available for quite a while. Towards the end of my study in 2015, I wanted to revive the prototypes. They were a large part of my PhD work, it would have been a shame to not have them available.

They're now hosted on my own server. There's the [Samford Sounds](http://phd-prototypes.from.anotherbyte.net/prototypes/checklist) and [Virtual Bird Walk Tour](http://phd-prototypes.from.anotherbyte.net/prototypes/bird_tour).
