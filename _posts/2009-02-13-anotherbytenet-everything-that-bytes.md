<p>Welcome to Anotherbyte.net. I've decided that I've spent enough time muddling through using free hosted blogs... It's time to do it myself. </p>

<p>To that end, this site will be about anything that interests me. That'd be mostly web dev. stuff. With some funny pictures. And an occasional quote. And links.... lots of links. I like links. I'll try to explain why they're good.</p>

<p>I also experiment quite a bit with web technologies. I'll hopefully post up some of my doings.... if I can drag some up from the past, I'll include them too!</p>

<p>So there you have it. Another site. Another blog. Another fool who thinks his stuff is more interesting than all the other fools out there. No. My aim, small as it is, is to hopefully make life easier for everyone else. And more fun. And less stressful. 
So, I say again...</p>

<p>Welcome.</p>
