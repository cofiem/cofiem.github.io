Well, just when we thought <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/infographics/cyclone-hamish/">cyclone Hamish</a> had decided to leave us alone, there's a goodbye present: <a href="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,25187733-952,00.html"> around 250 000 litres of oil</a>.<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.msq.qld.gov.au/Home/About_us/Msq_headlines/Headlines_pacific_adventurer">Pacific Adventurer</a>, a <a href="http://www.swireshipping.com/web/news.jsp?fid=368">Swire Shipping</a> vessel, which hit rough seas early Tuesday, March 10, had barrels of oil knocked from it's decks and it's hull pierced by loose containers. The resulting oil spill has affected Moreton Island and most parts of the Sunshine Coast.<br>
<br>
Amazingly, the clean-up is <a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25190038-29277,00.html">well under-way</a>, and apparently almost finished in some areas. That was blazingly quick! They're already discussing <a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25187292-29277,00.html">disaster recovery strategies for tourism</a>.<br>
<br>
The news has reached as far as <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2009-03/12/content_7573861.htm">China</a> and the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/4982481/Australian-beaches-hit-by-oil-slick-declared-a-disaster-zone.html">UK</a>.<br>

Some of the <a href="http://images.google.com.au/images?q=Pacific+Adventurer+oil">pictures</a> are <a href="http://news.ninemsn.com.au/glance/770575/wildlife-threatened-by-oil-spill">really</a> <a href="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/gallery/0,23816,5037917-17382,00.html">awful</a>, but thankfully very few animals have been harmed so far.
