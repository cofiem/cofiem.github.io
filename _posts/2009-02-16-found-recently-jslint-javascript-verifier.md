<p>"JSLint is a JavaScript program that looks for problems in JavaScript programs."</p>

<p>It will analyse your javascript, and point out errors, problems and even possible improvements. As it utilises a stricter sub-set of the ECMAScript Specification, it might even help you improve your scripts.</p>
