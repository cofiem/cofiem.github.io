<p>In <a href="http://romeda.org/blog/2009/05/simple-addressing-for-web-part-1.html" target="_blank">Simple Addressing for the Web</a>, Blaine Cook puts forward the idea of using email addresses as identifiers. Some very good ideas here. I do agree that email addresses are a simple, established addressing scheme to build on, but I do wonder about giving the power of providing identity to Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc. </p><p>I have two reasons for really liking OpenID - I can manage logins from one place, and I can use my own site as a delegate. There are heaps of OpenID providers. Could we have the same things using email addresses? Other options include <a href="http://santrajan.blogspot.com/2009/06/federated-identity-in-your-browser.html" target="_blank">using the browser</a> to manage your identity. This might run into problems with people that don&#39;t tend to use a single computer. I also like the idea of <a href="http://brad.livejournal.com/2357444.html" target="_blank">combining</a> a bunch of relatively new standards to map emails to URLS. This still has the issue of who is the provider, and how easy is it to choose. It&#39;s good to see the identity movement gaining some steam in the form of <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/F3dAcwl0oLU/" target="_blank">support from Google</a>.</p>
