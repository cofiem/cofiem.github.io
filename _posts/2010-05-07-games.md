<p>It's been a while since I've posted anything here, but I've been getting into a few games recently, and wanted to note down what I've done. First of all, I'm still quite happy with <a href="http://www.gog.com">Good Old Games</a> and <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Valve's Steam</a> store. I tend to go for the specials and bundles, as I'm not concerned with the latest and greatest, just good games.</p>

<p>Just today I found <a href="http://www.wolfire.com/humble">The Humble Indie Bundle</a> -  a pay what you want experiement for five rather brilliant indie games, plus donations to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child's_Play_(charity)">Child's play</a> and <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</a> a very active civil liberties group. The games are great (I've played one or two of them before), and the causes are right down my alley.</p>
