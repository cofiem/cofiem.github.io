<p>There is a lot of data out there. Following on from a <a href="http://anotherbyte.net/blog/where-are-the-australian-public-data-apis">previous post</a>, it's one thing to get to the data, understanding it is a just as big, if not bigger, challenge. That's where semantics, or <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/is_google_a_semantic_search_engine.php">the <em>meaning</em> of words</a> comes in. Machine readable meaning. It's starting to catch on. Semantics don't have to be added explicitly, they might be able to be <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/05/google-rich-snippets-semantic-web.html">determined by machines</a> in the future, but that isn't close.</p>

<p>Here are some of the bigger semantic efforts for the web and other documents:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a> - RDF in attributes</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_RDF">eRDF</a> - a subset of RDFa, similar to microformats</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRDDL">GRDDL</a> - extract Resource Descriptions from marked-up data (eg. get RDF from XHTML using XSLT).</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>Now all that's needed are some good tools or explanations as to how best add semantic meaning to existing websites. There are some <a href="http://microformats.org/get-started/">getting started</a> examples and <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page">processes</a> for adding microformats, <a href="http://rdfa.info/wiki/Examples-in-the-wild">'in-the-wild'</a> examples and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_RDF">simplifications</a> of RDFa for HTML.
</p>

<p>
Already the number of options are growing rapidly. Hopefully it will standardise soon, as <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=yahoo+google+bing+semantic">search engines</a> begin to put more emphasis on semantics.
