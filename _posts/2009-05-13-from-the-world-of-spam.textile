<p>These days spam is taken for granted. It's everywhere. Everyone gets it. Everyone (I hope) knows how to deal with it (hint: the delete button is not just for show). However, sometimes spam can be funny. Here are some phrases from spam emails:</p>

<p>A distinct watch trend here:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your wrist could talk, it would tell you that it wants a new watch.</li>
<li>For some people watch is only a time indicator but for you it can be a piece of jewelery.</li>

<p> And just random: </p>
<ul>
<li>Why not do that?</li>
</ul>
