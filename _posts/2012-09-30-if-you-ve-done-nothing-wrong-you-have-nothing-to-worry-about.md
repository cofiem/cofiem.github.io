<p>I really get annoyed when I read this in a news article, or quote or show of some sort. There's rarely reasonable discussion about it, and almost never pressure against it. Identity fraud is usually the only push-back, and that's usually responded to with "oh, it's not likely to happen to you".</p>

"if somebody's not going out to cause trouble they shouldn't have any problems having their ID scanned" - ID scanner company director Joel Sheehan quoted in <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/security-it/id-scans-raise-privacy-fears-20120930-26tv3.html">ID scans raise privacy fears</a> on <a href="http://www.theage.com.au">The Age</a>

<p>The guy obviously has a vested interest. Some good discussion on why this is never a reasonable point of view. E.g. "Privacy protects us from abuses by those in power, even if we're doing nothing wrong at the time of surveillance." - <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/05/the_value_of_pr.html">Bruce Schneier</a></p>
