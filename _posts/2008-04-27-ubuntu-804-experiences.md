A little while ago I decided to have a look at Linux. I chose Ubuntu, as it is widely used, and from what I've read, is one of the more advanced desktop Linux distributions.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I upgraded from Ubuntu 7.10 to 8.04. There are a couple of new features I like:<br />
<ul>
<li>New cd burning program</li>
<li>Firefox 3 Beta 5</li>
<li>kernel update</li>
<li>and a couple of other new and updated features.</li>
</ul>
The new clock gave me some trouble - whenever I clicked on it, the menu bars at the top and bottom would hang, although programs would still work. To restart or shutdown I'd have to commit computer-cide and push the restart button.<br />
<br />
The problem turned out to be that there were no locations defined for the clock. Once I added one or more, it worked fine. Some forums mention Evolution and the Google calendar plugin - I do not use evolution, nor the Google calendar plugin. So this was a separate issue.<br />
<br />
Overall, there are no gigantic changes, more behind-the-scenes updates. Which should help bring Ubuntu closer and closer to surpassing windows as a personal computer OS. Especially as there is next to nothing that can't be done out-of-the-box in Ubuntu, while windows requires a bunch of other (free and paid for) applications to bring it to Ubuntu's level.
