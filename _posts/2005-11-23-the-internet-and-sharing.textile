<p>I'm in the process of uploading photos to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> site, and I thought I'd make a note of my thoughts. It's amazing how the internet let's us share things these days. Photos, buying and selling (not sharing, exactly, but anyway), forums for discussion, utilities to share files, and of course blogs!</p>

<p>So many thoughts, feelings and emotion, expressed in writing. That's one of the drawbacks of sharing over the internet, it's currently only practical to share text-based items and thoughts. Hopefully soon we'll have more and better possibilities for voice, and even video. Of course, the growth of podcasting has shown that it can be done now.</p>

<p>Yeah, sorry, I have these occasional deep thoughts...</p>
