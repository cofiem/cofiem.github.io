Disheartened and worried by [this news](http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/consumer-security/parliament-bullied-to-pass-national-security-laws-says-greens-senator-scott-ludlam-20140924-10lir9.html):

>"the entire Australian internet could be monitored by just one warrant if ASIO wanted to do so, according to experts and digital rights advocates including the Australian Lawyers Alliance, journalist union the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance and Electronic Frontiers Australia."

Seriously, this does not seem like a liberal government. "Small government"? "Reducing intrusion into people's lives"? All there seems to be is a racketing up of government powers, with little regard for public concerns or rights. All in the name of 'safety'. This is not proportional, at all.
