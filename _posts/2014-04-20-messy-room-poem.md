A random one: a poem about a messy room by Shel Silverstein (found on [familyfriend poems](http://www.familyfriendpoems.com/poem/messy-room-by-shel-silverstein)).

>Whosever room this is should be ashamed!<br>
>His underwear is hanging on the lamp.<br>
>His raincoat is there in the overstuffed chair,<br>
>And the chair is becoming quite mucky and damp.<br>
>His workbook is wedged in the window,<br>
>His sweater's been thrown on the floor.<br>
>His scarf and one ski are beneath the TV,<br>
>And his pants have been carelessly hung on the door.<br>
>His books are all jammed in the closet,<br>
>His vest has been left in the hall.<br>
>A lizard named Ed is asleep in his bed,<br>
>And his smelly old sock has been stuck to the wall.<br>
>Whosever room this is should be ashamed!<br>
>Donald or Robert or Willie or--<br>
>Huh? You say it's mine? Oh, dear,<br>
>I knew it looked familiar!
