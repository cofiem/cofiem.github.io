<p>Writing content for the web is an exercise that I'm not sure I'm so good at. I just ran into <a href="http://www.usabilitypost.com/2009/12/08/make-it-difficult-to-read/">this article</a> about web writing, and the possibility that page views are not what it's all about. I'd like to add my two cents to this, and say that making the content easy to read may be one important part, but there are some much more important issues: actually writing (which I seem to be failing at, lately), and knowing your topic. No point writing clearly or in your own style, if you aren't writing anything.</p>

<p>On that note, I think my objectives for this blog aren't to make people spend more time reading it, but to get my thoughts down. There are quite a few things I would love to record and get feedback on. I am going to make a concerted effort to write more... but no promises.</p>

<p>In other news, Firefox 3.6 RC is out. It's really only <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.6rc1/releasenotes/">incremental updates</a>, but there are some interesting things in there, like async Javascript, WOFF fonts, Personas for changing appearance and numerous changes to how Firefox deals with plugins.</p>

<p>Let's just hope there's fewer crashes.</p>
