<p>I would love to do something for <a href="http://mashupaustralia.org/" target="_blank">MashupAustralia</a> - there&#39;s quite a few <a href="http://mashupaustralia.org/data-sources/" target="_blank">datasets</a> available to be used. Unfortunately I just don&#39;t have the time right now, and the comp only goes for a month. I could</p><ul><li>Not doing anything (this option makes me sad :( )&nbsp;</li><li>Try to squeeze in making something (unlikely)</li><li>Wait until the end of Nov when I should have more time (only a week, tho)</li><li>Or ask nicely for the comp to be extended (please?&nbsp; a month or two more?)</li></ul><p>I&#39;m certainly going to be doing something anyway, but I&#39;d love to be part of the comp. It only just opened (and there aren&#39;t any entries yet), but it&#39;ll hopefully produce some excellent stuff!</p><p>Go the data! </p>
