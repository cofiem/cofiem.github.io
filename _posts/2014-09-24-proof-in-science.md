I like this quote by referenced in this [article](https://theconversation.com/wheres-the-proof-in-science-there-is-none-30570) in The Conversation by Geraint Lewis. It comments on the general media saying things like 'science proves X', when really most results only give a slightly improved likelihood of representing reality.

> "I have approximate answers and possible beliefs in different degrees of certainty about different things, but I'm not absolutely sure of anything." â€” Richard Feynman

Prove: from Latin probare 'test, approve, demonstrate' - it is not about being certain.
