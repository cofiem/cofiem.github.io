<p>First, I've never heard of a kangaroo going for a swim in the surf. Until now... and it ended up needing to be saved! Got caught in a rip, and sharks had been seen around the same area, apparently. Anyway, who'd believe this story? Well, <a href="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,,25475511-3102,00.html">here's</a> the news articles, and there's also a video:</p>

<p  style="margin:0 auto;width:480px;"><object width="480" height="295"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/D1644XlsDkw&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/D1644XlsDkw&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295"></embed></object></p>

<p>Keeping to the new creatures on the beach theme, a Dutch sculptor, Theo Jansen, has come up with "Strandbeests", machines made from plastic tubes and bottles that 'live' on the beach - they can detect when they get near the water or the dry sand, and turn around. The 'creatures' get more and more complex and some look positively dinosaur-like. Have a look at the <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2007/09/theo_jansen.php">video on TED</a>.</p>

<p>And how could a beach be compete without a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maleo">Maleo</a> (<i>Macrocephalon maleo</i>)?  It is a rather <a href="http://images.google.com.au/images?q=maleo+Sulawesi">odd-looking</a> bird which lives only on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. Apparently the Maleo <a href="http://www.wcs.org/353624/wcs_rare_birds_get_private_beach">now has their own private beach-font reserve</a>, purchased for $12,500. The Wildlife Conservation Society together with a local group - Pelestari Alam Liar dan Satwa (PALS) - used donated funds to ensure that the remaining birds have a safe area to nest.</p>
