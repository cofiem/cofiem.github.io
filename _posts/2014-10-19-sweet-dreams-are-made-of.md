Some fun can be had remixing the lyrics for Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) by the Eurythmics. 
First of all, there are two official music videos [the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMFqkcPYcg)

The most well-known remix of the lyrics is for cheese!

> Sweet dreams are made of cheese,<br>
> who am I to diss a Brie.<br>
> I cheddar the world and the feta cheese,<br>
> everybody's looking for Stilton.<br>

> Some of them want to fondue you,<br>
> Some of them want to be fondued<br>
> Some of Edam want Roquefort, too.<br>
> Some of them want to have some Blue<br>

> Some of them want cheddar fondue,<br>
> Some them want to a sweet danish blue<br>

And here's one that was cobbled together by me and a few friends about teas!

> Sweet dreams are made of teas,<br>
> brew am chai to steep the leaves<br>
> I savour the world for the perfect earl grey<br>
> Everybodyâ€™s looking for darjeeling<br>
  
> Some of them want to infuse you,<br>
> Some of them want to be infused by you<br>
> Some of them want to cosy up to you,<br>
> Some of them want to be cosied by you<br>
