<p>I wholeheartedly agree with this.</p>
<blockquote>
Way late to this, but as a secular humanist AND a feminist, I find it doubly offensive when people say <i>"'Feminism' is too exclusionary, I'm a 'humanist'"</i> because it's an inaccurate use of "humanism," which is a secular worldview that suggests that our "moral" values should come from our life experiences rather than religious dogma, and that life can have meaning and value without belief in a higher power or afterlife. Humanists generally do believe in equal rights for all people, but that's not what "humanism" is about. Humanism IS NOT an alternative to feminism, it is a complex world view. &mdash; <a href="http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/04/12/faq-why-feminism-and-not-just-humanism-or-equalism-isnt-saying-youre-a-feminist-exclusionary/comment-page-1/#comment-67665">belongsomewhere</a> commenting on <a href="http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/04/12/faq-why-feminism-and-not-just-humanism-or-equalism-isnt-saying-youre-a-feminist-exclusionary/">Faq: Why "Feminism" And Not Just "Humanism"?
