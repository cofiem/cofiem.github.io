It is a little surprising to find the blog of the top guy at the company that hosts this site. I shouldn't be surprised, tho.... wouldn't you think the head of a tech company would know how to handle tech, and be able to use it? After all, they need to know their business. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be that common. The developers keep a blog, sure, but you'll rarely hear from those in charge. Good to see!<br>
