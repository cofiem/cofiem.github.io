This post was from [September 2011 on Tumblr](http://yet-anotherbyte-old.tumblr.com/post/10402365198/willowphoto-via-twitpic-share-photos-and). 
Based on a post by willowphoto on Tumblr.
Things have not gotten better :(

I hate to do this, but I’m really not proud of Australia these days. 

> Australians all let us reject,<br>
> Those who aren't young and free;<br>
> We've gotten spoiled and withheld our toil;<br>
> Except to guard our sea; <br>
> Elect not to share nature’s gifts <br>
> Of beauty rich and rare; <br>
> This sad story's page, is at the stage <br>
> Of loosing Australia Fair. <br>
> Our wasteful reigns force us to sing, <br>
> Please help Australia Fair.<br>

> Beneath our heavy Southern Cross <br>
> We'll withdraw our hearts and hands; <br>
> To fake this Commonwealth of ours <br>
> Took people from their lands; <br>
> For those who dare to cross the seas <br>
> We're not prepared to share; <br>
> With cowardice we turn our backs <br>
> On those who our seek our care. <br>
> In mournful pains for not keeping, <br>
> Our poor Australia Fair.

I hope I can look back at this and say we moved on and became better...

And here's another remix. I'm not sure where this is from. I've changed it a little bit.

> Australians all let us rejoice<br>
> for we are white and straight.<br>
> We've mined our soil and killed for oil<br>
> We've turned back refugees.<br>
> Our land abounds in trees to log<br>
> A reef to dump and dredge.<br>
> As Sirs and Dames,<br>
> We'll flout the shame,<br>
> Advance Australia Fair!<br>
> let profits reign, all serve the rich,<br>
> Advance Australia Fair
