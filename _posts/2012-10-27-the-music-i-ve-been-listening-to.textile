title: The state of Spotify

<p>I've been using spotify for a little while now, and I thought I'd put down some of my observations.</p>
<p>First of all, here's one of the playlists I've made - Upbeat, the encouraging songs that I like.</p>
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:1232595177:playlist:1JTfkGV6ibFxNiGlE9gPBQ" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<p>I'm paying $11.99 per month for access to a huge array of music, in addition to the large collection I have locally. Let's start with some of the things I think could be better:</p>
<ul>
<li>I find songs that I want to listen to that Spotify doesn't have more often that I'd like.</li>
<li>They still don't seem to support the <code>video</code> and <code>audio</code> elements. Which means all sorts of cool apps - visualisations, generated music, equalisers, games - can't be made or used.</li>
<li>There are some issues in navigation - some clicks start tracks playing, some go to info pages.</li>
<li>On occasion an app will just not work for a few days. This has happened with the lastfm, triple j and tunewiki apps.</li>
<li>Please, please, please, when I click on the close button, just close! Get rid of this silly 'close means minimise to the task bar/tray' stuff!</li>
<li>Are there really exactly 50 apps available? I would have thought there'd be many more than that.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now for the good:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is well past time that great desktop programs were simply wrappers around a browser. This is the way almost all desktop programs should be made.</li>
<li>Having said I find tracks Spotify doesn't have, there are so many excellent tracks available, it's usually not a problem.</li>
<li>The monthly $12 really does seem worth it to access pretty much any song I think of, when I think of it.</li>
<li>I like that queued tracks and other state is shared between computers. It doesn't always work, but it seems like it does. If I'm imagining this, then I guess my tastes are just that consistent.</li>
<li>Being able to see what other people are playing has been a great source of new tracks, bands and genres.</li>
</ul>
<p>So all in all, there are still some gaps, but worth the $12/month, and I've certainly enjoyed the access to existing favourites, and new favourites.</p>
