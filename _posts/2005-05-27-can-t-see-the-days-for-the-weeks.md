<p>Why does time fly by so fast when you don't want it to, and slow down when you wish it'd speed up? A question I'm sure everyone can relate to. No, I haven't had a bad day or anything, I just thought I'd talk about this. And other things. Of course.</p>

<p>Going to school/work can be either a long trip, full of absolutely nothing exciting, or a very quick trip, if you happen to be reading a book, talking to someone, or thinking. It's funny how time seems to want to act the opposite to what you want. You might be talking with someone on the Internet, and realise that you've spent 2 hours doing it, when it feels like you only began 10 minutes ago. Or, you might be waiting for a trainor bus, feeling like time's going backwards, and it gets later and later and everything's delayed, and you're freezing cold, and you'd just like to be home...</p>

<p>No, there's not much point to this post. Just for fun. I'm trying to find my topics.... And Occasional Randomness is certainly one of them.</p>

<P>So, next time you've got it great, or wish time would speed up, just remember: If time was always the same speed, that wouldn't be much fun, would it? Oh, hang on...</p>
