I just played Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee for the first time in many years. I still remember the secrets on the first few screens, and even how to do them! 

Such a creepy, vicious, gory, yet satisfying game.

(don't follow the instructions on the first few screens. They're getting you to do horrible things...)
