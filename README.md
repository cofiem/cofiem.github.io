# Mark's blog

A jekyll and Github pages powered personal blog.

Uses the [Lagom theme](https://github.com/swanson/lagom) by [@swanson](https://github.com/swanson).

## Creating a new post

New posts are created in `/_posts`, named in the format `yyyy-mm-dd-title`, where title is an alphanumeric dash-separated string.
Drafts can be created in `/_drafts`, using the same file name format.

The website can be previewed and regenerated as the pages are edited, just as Github does. Start the jekyll server:

    bundle exec jekyll serve

Or just build the site:

    bundle exec jekyll build
